@deftypefun {void} {gnutls_record_cork} (gnutls_session_t @var{session})
@var{session}: is a @code{gnutls_session_t}  structure.

If called @code{gnutls_record_send()}  will no longer send partial records.
All queued records will be sent when @code{gnutls_uncork()}  is called, or
when the maximum record size is reached.
